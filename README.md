## Description
This is an instant messaging service with authentication via social media, such as Facebook. The service allows users to send text messages and share links. 

This project is a showcase of my technical skills and talent for potential IT recruiters, employers, customers, etc. It demonstrates that I am able to
* create a single-page web application with Angular
* implement reactive state management with NgRx store in Angular applications
* understand the basic principles of the OpenAPI Specification
* understand microservice communication patterns and protocols, such as GRPC
* understand the main principles of microservice architecture, event-driven development, and experienced in using Apache Kafka
## Architecture

| Chat API | REST | Responsible for sending messages and account management |
| Authentication | GRPC | Generates and validates JSON Web Tokens |
| Notification | Apache Kafka, SignalR | Sends out notifications about new messages |
| Link preview | Apache Kafka | Decorates messages with a website's name and a picture preview, if a message contains links |
| File storage | GRPC Web | Saves a user's avatar on the file system, serves avatars by request |
